# Problem/Feature Solution Analysis Framework

## Instructions

1. **No Code Implementation** - Focus on analysis and design only
2. **Problem Definition** - Clearly articulate the problem/feature request
3. **Assumptions** - List specific, testable assumptions
4. **Acceptance Criteria** - Define measurable success conditions
5. **Impact Analysis** - Identify all affected components
6. **Technical Debt Assessment** - Evaluate debt creation/reduction
7. **Solution Generation** - Propose multiple viable approaches
8. **Comparative Analysis** - Systematic solution evaluation
9. **Risk Assessment** - Analyze failure modes and impacts
10. **Recommendation** - Data-driven solution selection
11. **Clarification** - Request additional information if needed

## Analysis Template

### 1. Problem/Feature Definition
**What exactly needs to be solved or implemented?**
- [ ] Business context and motivation
- [ ] Current state vs. desired state
- [ ] Success metrics and KPIs
- [ ] Constraints and limitations

### 2. Assumptions
**List specific, verifiable assumptions:**
- [ ] Technical assumptions (APIs, databases, frameworks)
- [ ] Business assumptions (user behavior, volume, frequency)
- [ ] Resource assumptions (time, budget, team size)
- [ ] Environmental assumptions (infrastructure, dependencies)

### 3. Acceptance Criteria
**Measurable conditions for completion:**
- [ ] Functional requirements (what it must do)
- [ ] Non-functional requirements (performance, security, usability)
- [ ] Quality gates (test coverage, documentation)
- [ ] Rollback/recovery criteria

### 4. Impact Analysis
**Identify affected components using dependency analysis:**
- [ ] **Direct impacts:** Files/modules requiring changes
- [ ] **Indirect impacts:** Dependencies and dependents
- [ ] **Data impacts:** Database schema, migrations, data flow
- [ ] **Integration impacts:** APIs, third-party services, external systems
- [ ] **Infrastructure impacts:** Deployment, monitoring, scaling

### 5. Technical Debt Assessment
- [ ] **Creates debt:** New complexity, shortcuts, maintenance burden
- [ ] **Reduces debt:** Consolidation, refactoring, standardization
- [ ] **Neutral:** No significant impact on codebase quality

### 6. Solution Alternatives
**Generate 3-5 distinct approaches:**
- Solution A: [Brief description]
- Solution B: [Brief description]
- Solution C: [Brief description]
- Solution D: [Brief description] *(if applicable)*
