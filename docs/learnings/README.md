## Top 10 Implementation Challenges

### Latest Implementation Issues (Test Fixing - 2024)

### 6. [Test Process Hanging Due to Active Handles](./6-test-process-hanging-active-handles.md)
**Issue**: Test processes hang indefinitely preventing any tests from completing
- **Impact**: Complete testing blockage, false failure assumptions, workflow disruption
- **Solution**: Resource tracking system, comprehensive cleanup, mock operations
- **Prevention**: Track instances with persistent resources, use fake timers, mock async operations

### 7. [Vue 3 Reactive Reference Access in Tests](./7-vue3-reactive-reference-access-in-tests.md)
**Issue**: Test assertions failing due to Vue 3 reactive references returning RefImpl objects
- **Impact**: High test failure rate, debugging complexity, false negative tests
- **Solution**: Systematic .value access, helper functions, comprehensive test updates
- **Prevention**: Always use .value with reactive references, type-safe testing patterns

### 8. [Resource Cleanup in Test Lifecycle Management](./8-resource-cleanup-test-lifecycle-management.md)
**Issue**: Test resources not properly cleaned up between tests causing memory leaks
- **Impact**: Test reliability degradation, memory leaks, CI/CD pipeline issues
- **Solution**: Resource tracking system, comprehensive cleanup strategy, enhanced composable design
- **Prevention**: Track all resource instances, provide cleanup methods, use test lifecycle hooks

### 9. [Vitest Environment Variable Mocking Limitations](./9-vitest-environment-variable-mocking-limitations.md)
**Issue**: Unable to mock import.meta.env variables due to immutability constraints
- **Impact**: Incomplete test coverage, false test assumptions, CI/CD inconsistencies
- **Solution**: Adaptive test expectations, configuration override patterns, dependency injection
- **Prevention**: Environment-agnostic design, configuration-driven testing, feature flags

### 10. [Configuration-Dependent Test Behavior](./10-configuration-dependent-test-behavior.md)
**Issue**: Tests failing due to mismatches between expected and actual default configuration
- **Impact**: Inconsistent test results, false negative tests, debugging complexity
- **Solution**: Explicit test configuration, configuration-aware helpers, feature-specific config
- **Prevention**: Document configuration options, explicit test settings, configuration presets

## Original Implementation Challenges

### 1. [Vue 3 Property Binding with Undefined Variables](./1-vue3-property-binding-undefined-variables.md)
**Issue**: Components using `:prop="variableName"` where `variableName` is undefined
- **Impact**: Vue warnings, test failures, component rendering issues
- **Solution**: Use string literals or properly declare variables
- **Prevention**: ESLint rules, TypeScript strict mode, code review checklists

### 2. [Vue 3 Mock Component Event Handling](./2-vue3-mock-component-event-handling.md)
**Issue**: Mock components not properly emitting events in Vue Test Utils
- **Impact**: Form interaction tests failing, unreliable event testing
- **Solution**: Updated mock structure with `setup()` function and proper emit handling
- **Prevention**: Vue 3 specific mock templates, component-based selectors

### 3. [Test Expectations vs Component Behavior Mismatch](./3-test-expectations-vs-component-behavior.md)
**Issue**: Hardcoded test expectations not matching actual component calculations
- **Impact**: High test failure rate, false assumptions about business logic
- **Solution**: Component-first analysis, relationship testing, reactive behavior understanding
- **Prevention**: Read implementation before testing, validate business logic independently

### 4. [Vue 3 Composition API Method Spying Challenges](./4-vue3-composition-api-method-spying.md)
**Issue**: Traditional method spying doesn't work with Vue 3 Composition API
- **Impact**: Reactive behavior tests failing, unreliable spy setup
- **Solution**: State-based testing instead of method spying, behavior verification
- **Prevention**: Test outputs not implementation, use direct method calls

### 5. [Medical Domain Testing Complexity](./5-medical-domain-testing-complexity.md)
**Issue**: Balancing comprehensive medical logic testing with maintainable code
- **Impact**: Test complexity explosion, domain knowledge requirements
- **Solution**: Structured medical testing framework, clinical scenario patterns
- **Prevention**: Medical domain architecture, regulatory compliance patterns

## Key Success Factors

### 1. Component-First Analysis
- Read actual implementation before writing tests
- Understand reactive dependencies and watchers
- Map component lifecycle and calculation flows

### 2. Framework-Specific Patterns
- Use Vue 3 specific testing approaches
- Leverage Composition API strengths
- Work with reactivity system, not against it

### 3. Domain-Driven Testing
- Structure tests around medical scenarios
- Validate against clinical guidelines
- Prioritize patient safety over test convenience

### 4. Iterative Validation
- Test at multiple levels (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- Cross-validate results against independent calculations
- Use real-world patient scenarios

## Best Practices Summary

### DO:
- ✅ Read component implementation before testing
- ✅ Use string literals for static props
- ✅ Test component state changes over method calls
- ✅ Structure medical tests around clinical scenarios
